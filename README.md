> - **randomMover.py**: game agent that plays chess based on random moves
> - **slowMover.py**: randomMover but sleeps for random amounts of time to slow itself down
> - **smartMover.py**: game agent that uses AI (minimax with alphaBetaPruning, negamax with quiescence, evaluation and fancified eval)
> - **humanMover.py**: agent that accepts human input in CLI as uci-formatted strings e.g. 'g1f3'
